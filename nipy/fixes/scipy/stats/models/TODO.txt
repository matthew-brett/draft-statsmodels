Tests
----------
Tests for Contrast (doing now)
Tests for other methods in Model.py
Tests for other links in GLM
Test I/O of models wrt array types, dimensions
Check that rpy is installed

Issues
----------
GLS residuals - whitened or not? (ie., Z - dot(wdesign, params) or
endog - dot(exog,params))
   -I think not...
AR - I need to check my references, but right now AR is done through a
two-stage iterative fit.  Does this always make sense?
   -test for this (only univariate yule-walker is tested right now)
Make sure all results are computed where they should be

Other cleanup
--------------------
Combine tools and utils?
   -move isestimable to tools/utils and use it?
Move cox/survival, mixed, and GAM to "sandbox"?
Put formulas in docstring? (this could become "heavy"...)

Update all examples/docstrings
Run lint
Technical docs (theory, references, formulas)
Install for standalone package

Remove formula dependency
