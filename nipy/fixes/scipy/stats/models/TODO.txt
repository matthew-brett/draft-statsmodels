Tests
----------
Tests for Contrast (doing now) (no idea, needs refactoring?)
    -check reference out from library
    -seems simple enough, though I just don't have an example for the usage
    -need to find data that's appropriate for contrast analysis
Tests for other methods in Model.py 
Tests for other links in GLM
    -get data from Stata/remaining residuals from Stata
Test I/O of models wrt array types, dimensions
Check that rpy is installed (done)
Make sure all tests actually run...
    -some problems with removing imports from __init__ have been hidden

Issues
----------
GLS residuals - whitened or not? (ie., Z - dot(wdesign, params) or
endog - dot(exog,params))
   -I think not... (leaving as not)
AR - I need to check my references, but right now AR is done through a
two-stage iterative fit.  Does this always make sense?
   -test for this (only univariate yule-walker is tested right now)
Make sure all results are computed where they should be
Need to clip mu's in GLM to avoid np.log(0), etc.
GLM is very slow for many data points (see Inverse Gaussian)
    -I suspect this is from np.eye in cov_params being calculated for
        each iteration of WLS, with large data...


Other cleanup
--------------------
Combine tools and utils?
   -move isestimable to tools/utils and use it?
Move cox/survival, mixed, and GAM to "sandbox"?
Put formulas in docstring? (this could become "heavy"...)
Decide on where to put HCCM robust estimators.


Update all examples/docstrings
Run lint
Technical docs (theory, references, formulas)
Install for standalone package

Remove formula dependency
