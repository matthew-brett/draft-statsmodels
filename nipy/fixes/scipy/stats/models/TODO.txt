Tests
----------
Test I/O of models wrt array types, dimensions
    - add checks in all top class for data
Make sure all tests actually run...
    -some problems with removing imports from __init__ have been hidden
Test residuals, stats for weighted least squares

Issues
----------
GLS residuals - whitened or not? (ie., Z - dot(wdesign, params) or
endog - dot(exog,params))
   -I think not... (leaving as not)
AR - test for this (only univariate yule-walker is tested right now)
Make sure all results are computed where they should be
Need to clip mu's in GLM to avoid np.log(0), etc. (done for gamma)

Other cleanup
--------------------
Put formulas in docstring? (this could become "heavy"...)
    -no make a /docs/ folder for technical documentation in .rst format
Check all imports, cut out what's not needed


Update all examples/docstrings
Make sure docs examples run
Run lint
Technical docs (theory, references, formulas)
Install for standalone package
