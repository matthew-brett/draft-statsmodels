Regression
==========

Regression contains linear models with independently and identically 
distributed errors and for errors with heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation

The statistical model is assumed to be

 :math:`Y = X\beta + \mu`,  where :math:`\mu\sim N\left(0,\sigma^{2}\Sigma\right)`

depending on the assumption on :math:`\Sigma`, we have currently four classes available

* GLS : generalized least squares for arbitrary covariance :math:`\Sigma`
* OLS : ordinary least squares for i.i.d. errors :math:`\Sigma=\textbf{I}`
* WLS : weighted least squares for heteroskedastic errors :math:`\text{diag}\left(\Sigma\right)`
* GLSAR : feasible generalized least squares with autocorrelated AR(p) errors :math:`\Sigma=\Sigma\left(\rho\right)`

All regression models define the same methods and follow the same structure, 
and can be used in a similar fashion. Some of them contain additional model 
spedific methods and attributes.

GLS is the superclass of the other regression classes.
