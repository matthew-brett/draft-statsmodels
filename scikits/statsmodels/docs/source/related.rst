Related Packages
================

These are some python packages that have a related purpose and can be
useful in combination with statsmodels. The selection in this list is
biased towards packages that might be directly useful for data handling and
statistical analysis, and towards those that have a BSD compatible license, 
which implies that we are not restricted in looking at the source to learn 
different ways of implementation or different algorithms. 



Data Handling
-------------

Scikits.timeseries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.timeseries

"Time series manipulation

The scikits.timeseries module provides classes and functions for manipulating, 
reporting, and plotting time series of various frequencies. The focus is on 
convenient data access and manipulation while leveraging the existing 
mathematical functionality in Numpy and SciPy."

 * Licence: BSD
 * Language: Python, C
 * binary distributions available

*Comments*

Timeseries is based on numpys MaskedArray and is designed for handling data 
with missing values. It also includes functions for statistical analysis.


Pandas
^^^^^^

http://code.google.com/p/pandas/

"This project aims to provide the following
 * A set of fast NumPy-based data structures optimized for panel, time series, 
   and cross-sectional data analysis.
 * A set of tools for loading such data from various sources and providing 
   efficient ways to persist the data. 
 * A robust statistics and econometrics library which closely integrates with 
   the core data structures."
(quotes from project page)


License: New BSD
language: Python, Cython
no binary distributions available, not released yet but code used in production

*Comments*

Uses statsmodels as optional dependency for statistical analysis. Focused on
a two-dimensional representation of the data. It allows for arbitrary 
axis labels, but offers also a convenient time series class.


Tabular
^^^^^^^

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabular

"Tabular data container and associated convenience routines in Python

Tabular is a package of Python modules for working with tabular data. Its main 
object is the tabarray class, a data structure for holding and manipulating 
tabular data. 

The tabarray object is based on the ndarray object from the Numerical Python 
package (NumPy), and the Tabular package is built to interface well with NumPy 
in general. "

License: MIT
Language: Python

*Comments*

Uses numpys structured arrays as basic building block. Focused on 
spreadsheet-style operations for working with two-dimensional tables and 
associated data handling and analysis.
It is instructive to read the code of tabular for working with structured 
arrays. 



Data Analysis
-------------

KF - Kalman Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/KF

"This project was started to test different avaiable tools to track mutual 
funds and hedge fund using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM thereafter) 
introduced my Sharpe and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT thereafter) introduced 
by Ross.
"

 * License : BSD -check
 * Language Python (requires cvxopt)


*Comments*
Very young project but with a similar, although narrower, focus as pandas
and (parts of) statsmodels. Uses Kalman Filter for rolling linear regression 
and allows for equality and inequality constraints in the estimation. 
Includes its own time series class, and the estimation seems (?) to depend on
it.


Scikits.talkbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.talkbox

Talkbox is set of python modules for speech/signal processing. The goal of this
toolbox is to be a sandbox for features which may end up in scipy at some
point. 

License: BSD
Language: Python, C optional


*Comments*

Although specialized on speech processing, talkbox has some accessible and
useful functions for time series analysis, especially a fast implementation
for estimating AR models (with ...) and spectral density based on estimated
AR coefficients.


Nitime
^^^^^^
http://github.com/fperez/nitime

"Nitime is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience experiments.

It contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in 
the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent 
time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the 
numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with 
compact and semantically clear code."

License: BSD
Language: Python

*Comments*
Althoug focused on neuroscience, the algorithms for time series analysis are
independent of the data representation and can be used with numpy arrays.
Current focus is on spectral analysis including coherence between several
time series.




Pymc
^^^^

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymc

"Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is 
an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. 
PyMC is a python module that implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm 
as a python class, and is extremely flexible and applicable to a large suite 
of problems.""

License: MIT, Academic Free License (?)
Language: Python, C, Fortran
binary (bundle ?) installer

*Comments*
This is to some extent the modern Bayesian analog of statsmodels. It is by 
far the most mature project in this group including statsmodels.




Domain-specific Data Analysis
-----------------------------

The following packages contain interesting statistical algorithms, however
they are tightly focused on their application, and are or might be more 
difficult to use "from the outside".

Pymvpa
^^^^^^

Nipy
^^^^

Biopython
^^^^^^^^^

Pysal
^^^^^



Other packages
--------------

There exists a large number of machine learning packages in python, many of
them with a well established code base. Unfortunately, none of the packages 
with a wider coverage of algorithms has a scipy compatible license. 
A listing can be found at 
scikits.learn includes several machine learning algorithms.

Other packages are available that could provide additional functionality,
especially openopt which offers additional optimization routines compared to
the ones in scipy.
